title: "Rivet Building Methodology"
---

- Your product is not complete without documentation
- Build for the high school student just learning to build games and the industry veteran
- Classify tech debt as long-term and short-term; it's OK to take on short-term tech debt
- Develop like you're running in production
    - No more "works on my laptop"
    - Reduce time to market by reducing the difference between dev & prod; removes the need for a staging server
    - All developers become familiar with production infrastructure
    - Collaboration enabled out of the box
    - Stress test your IaaS; if everyone uses it, it has to be good
- There is no such thing as user error
- Always add TLDR to your docs
- If you want it done better, do it yourself
- Build everything you do with accessibility of other employees in mind
    - Bottlenecks come from teams trying to coordinate with each other
    - We hire talented people who you can trust to work on any part of Rivet. Make sure everything is built with the intent for anyone to modify it. The designer should be able to edit the website and the developer should be able to edit the graphics.
