title: "Rivet Building Methodology"
---

- Your product is not complete without documentation
- Build for the high school student just learning to build games and the industry veteran
- Classify tech debt as long-term and short-term; it's OK to take on short-term tech debt
- Develop like you're running in production
    - No more "works on my laptop"
    - Reduce time to market by reducing the difference between dev & prod; removes the need for a staging server
    - All developers become familiar with production infrastructure
    - Collaboration enabled out of the box
    - Stress test your IaaS; if everyone uses it, it has to be good
