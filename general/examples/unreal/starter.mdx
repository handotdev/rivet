This guide will walk you through creating and deploying a multiplayer game with Unreal Engine.

This guide was written using Unreal Engine 5.1.1. This process is similar if using Unreal Engine 4. If you're using a different version of Unreal Engine and need help, don't hesitate to [reach out](https://discord.gg/BG2vqsJczH).

## Step 1: Prepare Unreal Engine

### Download the Unreal Engine cross-compilation toolchain

[Download here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/linux-development-requirements-for-unreal-engine/)

- Make sure you download the version corresponding to your Unreal version
- You may have to restart

### Download the Unreal Engine source code

https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/downloading-unreal-engine-source-code/

- Join GitHub team
- Clone UnrealEngine repo

### Build the Unreal Engine editor

https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/setting-up-dedicated-servers-in-unreal-engine/

1. `.\Setup.bat`
1. `.\GenerateProjectFiles.bat`
    - You'll see a warning: `Some Platforms were skipped due to invalid SDK setup:`
    - Make sure that `Linux` is not listed here. If so, then step 1 was not done correctly.
1. Open UE5.sln
1. Set *Solution Configuration* to *Development Editor*
1. Set *Solution Platform* to *Win64*
1. Right click *UE5* target in right sidebar and click *Build*
    - Takes ~5 hours depending on your hardware
1. Right click on *UE5* in the sidebar and click *Debug > Start New Instance*
1. Unreal Engine is built to at `UnrealEngine\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor`
    - Create a shortcut somewhere for quick access in the future

## Step 2: Setup the Unreal Engine project

We'll be using the third-person template from Unreal Engine since all of the components come with networking out of the box. These steps also apply to any other networked Unreal Engine game.

<Warn>
	If you're following this guide on an existing project, ensure that your project is version controlled.
</Warn>

### Create third person template (or bring your project)

Use the C++ version. While Rivet also works with Blueprints, we haven't put together a guide for that yet.

### Test locally

1. Configure PIE networking configuration
1. Run the project
1. Check that you can see your players running around

### Configure server solution

### Build Linux server

---

## Step 3: Setup Rivet project

### Install Rivet CLI

### Write server Dockerfile

### Create a download page

### Initiate project

---

## Step 4: Integrate with Rivet

### Build connection UI

### Build connection code

### Test locally

---

## Step 5: Publish


---

## TODO

- Install WSL server
- Build server
