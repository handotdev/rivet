## Who is Rivet built for?

We've spent years building 

Rivet is built for anyone building multiplayer games.

We want to support hobby developers just getting started to studios with large teams.

If you're already running a multiplayer game, it's not hard to switch to Rivet.

## Who is Rivet *not* for?

### Single player game developers

Rivet is primarily focused on enabling multiplayer developers to run their games.

Rivet CDN, Rivet Identities, and Rivet KV can still be used for single player games. If you find these helpful, we'd love to hear from you!
