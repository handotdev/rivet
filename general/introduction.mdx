## Who is Rivet built for?

Rivet is built to support hobby developers that are just getting started to studios with large teams.

If you're starting from scratch, Rivet will help you focus on building content and launch when you're ready.

If you're already running a multiplayer game, Rivet can help streamline operating an existing game.

If you're building any form of realtime non-game software, Rivet can help you run your realtime servers across our many regions. If you have a specific use case in mind, [please reach out](https://discord.gg/BG2vqsJczH)!

## Who is Rivet *not* for?

Single player game developers aren't going to find Rivet very helpful, since it's built primarily for multiplayer games.

However, Rivet CDN, Identities, and KV can still be used for single player games. If you find these helpful, [we'd love to hear from you](https://discord.gg/BG2vqsJczH)!
